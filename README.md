# walker
###Python API for random walk on Gaussian potential

This code is a simple API designed to generate brownian simulations along any desired potential. Simulations of the random particle walker are executed in fortran code using f2py. Compilation is simple can be completed by

  `f2py -f ./walker/util/_simulate.f95 --fcompiler='gfortran' -f90flags='-Wno-tabs' -m ./walker/util/_simulate`
